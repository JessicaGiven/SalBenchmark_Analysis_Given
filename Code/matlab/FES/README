Proc. Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA 2011), 2011, Ystad, Sweden.

The code has been tested on Matlab 2010a (32-bit) running windows. This code is publicly available for demonstration and educational
purposes, any commercial use without permission is strictly prohibited.

This package contains the following files and directories:
1) calculateImageSaliency.p : computes image saliency for a single scale
2) calculateFinalSaliency.m : computes image saliency for multiple scales
3) runSaliency.m : a sample file to show how to compute saliency
4) prior.mat : a prior obtained via learning

To test:
1) Extract the package
2) run 'runSaliency.m'
